# Translation Post-Processing

Translation of Markdown files is a problem overall.
This article takes a look at the problem of translating anchor-links that are generated by mkdocs.

In Markdown, you create links with the following syntax:

    [Link text](relative/path/to/file.md#anchor)

The problem is, when the section titles are translated, the anchor links no longer work, since they target the titles.
The links would have to be translated as well.
Since the `#anchor` part of the link is processed by Markdown in a way that is not obvious to the user (lowercase and normalization of special characters), this could be really hard for translators to get right.

A workaround would be the use of [custom anchor labels](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/toc/#custom-labels).

In `file.md` you can then define an anchor like

    ## Anchor { #anchor}

and keep referencing the anchor label.

This can even be automated so that Markdown files are translated, and in a post-processing step that compares the original version and the translated version the anchor labels for the translated section titles will be generated from the original anchor texts.

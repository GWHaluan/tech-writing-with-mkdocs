# Technical Writing with mkdocs

Hello!

I am a Technical Writer specializing in software documentation and I am using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to create my user documentation and API documentation.

On this github pages space, I want to write about tricks and methods that I discovered to improve mkdocs.

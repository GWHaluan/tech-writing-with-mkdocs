# Why mkdocs?

There are many ways to organize your Technical Writing.
What it comes down to, is your specific use case.
When i started my last job, the situation was this:

* We wanted to provide useful user documentation
* There were many Word documents that were or were not up to date
* Confluence and Scroll Viewport were proposed as a solution
* Some effort had been done to implement this, mostly text conversion from Word to Confluence

We decided against Confluence and used Markdown and mkdocs instead.
Our reasons were:

* Confluence and most of its plugins are proprietary and WYSIWYG
* For business reasons, we did not have direct control over Scroll Viewport styling
* There was no link between Confluence and the software release process
* We saw a major gap to our software development as developers disliked using Confluence
* Pipeline and deployment tools were already in use in the development teams
* Markdown is simple and therefore easily customizable and portable

## Features

### Easy collaboration

## Problems
